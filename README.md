# Measurement-of-a-PSF-using-the-Pacto-spectrometer

Avasoft settings:
-	Integration time = 5 sec
-	Averaging = 5
-	Dark = Ok
-	2d mode On
-	SD mode On

\
Setup: 
-	SLS202 as light source
-	SLS202 connected to 25 µm fibre, second end of fibre is mounted.
-	In front of this fibre is lens with focal length equal to about 10 cm. 
-	Distance between fibre end which is light source to lens is 25 cm.
-	In front of lens is 50 µm fibre mounted on xy translator, 16 cm 7mm from lens.
-	On top of translator, piece of paper with protractor printed on it
-	Image from 25 fibre should form at the entrance of 50 fibre.
-	The 50 µm fibre acting as receiver of light, is connected to Pacto spectrometer which is connected to the laptop. 
-	Position of 50 µm fibre was chosen such that we observe high counts on spectrum and the maximum is around green wavelengths (we are limited by chromatic aberration and while moving the fibre, maximum’s position changes in expected way). 
-	Protractor is fixed using bluetack.
-	Light in the room is turned off during measurements as it was interfering.

Procedure:
-	Spectra are taken every 5 degrees, starting from 0. 
-	Angle is red by looking from above and trying to align the key with the protractor lines. 
-	The key is not touched, the xy screw is rotated by pushing piece of wire fixed to it. This should improve precision and help to prevent the key from moving. 
-	Note: moving clockwise is noted by positive angles
